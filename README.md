# PoGo-Captcha [Discontinued]
# It requires a rewrite because of the wrong requests flow. I won't do it as actually all the apps already handle captchas.
Tool to simplify captcha solving on your accounts. Can be used for both manual and automatic solving (using 2captcha).
It supports proxies and hash server.

# Todo
- Implement the ability to save logs in a file & split accounts in different files to obtain three files: a file containing all the account that didn't had a captcha, a file with all the account that had a captcha and it has been solved, and a file containing all the accounts who had any sort of issue (login/captcha solving or anything else)
- Implement PGM config.ini reading to import accounts
- Implement reading location from accounts.csv, in this way every account can have a different location
- Implement threads, in this way we could speed up the tool

# Requirements
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- Don't forget Chromedriver & PhantomJS (follow Pikaptcha guide)

# Known issues
Someone is experiencing issues with selenium/phatomjs/chromedriver. Try with different versions of these.
Someone experienced issues running Python x86. Solved installing x64.

# Credits
Mainly based on Pikaptcha script for solving captcha. Improved adding new 'pageurl' parameter requested by 2captcha.
Thanks to Chrales & Fokse for ideas, tests and coding help.
